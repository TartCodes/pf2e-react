# Build Your Path

- Currently refactoring my previous Pathfinder2e character manager app (which was built using vanilla JS, EJS, Node/Epress, and MongoDB)
- When completed users will be able to create accounts, login, create and customize characters, and other features commonly used in the Pathfinder2e game system

#To Do
